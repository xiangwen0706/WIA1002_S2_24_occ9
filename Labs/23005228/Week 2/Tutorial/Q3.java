    //Raw type is a generic class or interface used without specifying a concrete type or without a type parameter.
    //Raw type is unsafe because some errors cannot be detected by the compiler, programmer only can found the error when he run the program.
    //Raw type is allowed in Java as a concession to compatibility of legacy code only.
