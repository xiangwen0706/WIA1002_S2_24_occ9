My name is Chin Jun Quan with matrix number, 22113308. I am majoring in Computer System & Networking. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because data structure is fun.

I acquired B for my previous Programming I course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will study hard. Wish me luck!!!
Its me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did very well in this course. I am happy with it. I learn very much from DS such as linked list and stack. I get A+ from it and I am so happy : )
